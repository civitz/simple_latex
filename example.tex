\section{Getting things done easily}
\label{sec:gtde}
\subsection{Using the template}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Copy the \verb!simple.tex! file of this package in the root directory of your \LaTeX{} document. 
 \item Use \verb!\input{simple}! to import the template and the necessary packages.
 \item Write your document like a boss
\end{enumerate}
As you may wonder: yes, this document is made with that template. 
I'll try to keep this exact document as simple as possible, so that my friends (and possibly yours) 
can use this document's tex file as a reference for their adventure in the \LaTeX{} world.

\subsection{Inserting an image}
\begin{verbatim}
 \singlefigure{testimage.png}{A single figure}{fig:single}
\end{verbatim}
The \verb!\singlefigure! command lets you easily insert an image in a document.
You must provide 3 parameters to the command: 
\begin{description}
 \item[Image name] 
    Images must be in the \verb!/img/! subfolder.
 \item[Figure caption] 
    The caption you want to appear below the image.
 \item[Figure reference label] 
    The label you want to assign to reference that figure in the document. 
    This will be made optional in figure versions of this template.
\end{description}
\singlefigure{testimage.png}{A single figure.}{fig:single}
Figure \ref{fig:single} has been inserted with the above command.

Keep in mind that images are inserted by keeping the aspect ratio and making their 
width fit the line width. 
This way thin images may become very big: 
this will be fixed in the next versions of the template. 
\subsection{Inserting two images side-by-side}
\begin{verbatim}
 \doublefigure{testimage.png}{Foo.}{fig:foo}{anotherimage.png}{Bar.}{fig:bar}
\end{verbatim}
The \verb!\doublefigure! command lets you insert two figures side by side, with one caption and label each.

The syntax is the same as the \verb!\singleimage! command, but doubled, as you may guess by the example. 
As before, figure \ref{fig:foo} and figure \ref{fig:bar} has been insert by the command above.

\doublefigure{testimage.png}{Foo.}{fig:foo}{anotherimage.png}{Bar.}{fig:bar}


\end{document}
